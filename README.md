# About the project
This project is a simple GUI app created to help players of Genshin Impact. Programm shows which characters and weapons materials can be farmed on a given day. When you launch programm it automaticly shows u materials for current day, but you can see other days by clicking the corresponding tab. You can see what material character or weapon needs by hovering your mouse over it. Programm hasn't been updated since Febuary 2021 so It is up-to-date to Genshin Impact 1.3.<br />
This programm is my first attempt of creating simple GUI with pygame.
